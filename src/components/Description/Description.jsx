                I love diving deep into understanding people and their experiences to create designs that truly enhance their lives.
                 As a storyteller, narrator, and performing artist, I bring creativity into every aspect of my work. 
                 I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy building teams that share a common goal of making meaningful,
